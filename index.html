                <h2>JavaScript: Control Flow - Loops</h2>
                <h6>September 10, 2023</h6>
        
                <p>In the realm of application logic, loops reign supreme, determining what happens, how it unfolds, and for how
                    long. Dive into the symphony of loops, where various methods lead to the same destination in handling iterative
                    tasks. Among the loops, one particularly handy tool stands out...</p>
                
                <h4>for Loops</h4>
                
                <p>When it comes to arrays, the <code>for</code> loop takes the spotlight, enabling the execution of code for each
                    index within the array. Let's harness its syntax:</p>
                
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>
                        const fruit = ['apple', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'banana'];
                        <br><br>for (let i = 0; i &lt; fruit.length; i++) {
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // code to execute for each index
                        <br>}
                    </code>
                </aside>
                
                <p>Breaking it down:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Begin by specifying where in the array you want to start. <code>let i =
                            0</code> sets the initial index to zero (the first value).</li>
                    <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Define where in the array you want to stop. Typically, we iterate up to the
                        last value in the array, denoted by <code>i &lt; fruit.length</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Specify how you want to traverse the array. Use <code>i += 1</code> or the
                        shorthand <code>i++</code> to go through values one after another. Adjust as needed, like
                        <code>i += 2</code> for every other value or <code>i += 3</code> for every third value, and so on.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>For instance, if our goal is to print the value of each index in the <code>fruit</code> array using a
                    <code>for</code> loop, the code would look like this:</p>
                
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>
                        for (let i = 0; i &lt; fruit.length; i++) {
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; console.log(fruit[i]);
                        <br>}
                    </code>
                </aside>
            </article>
              
            <article id="resources">

                <h2>JavaScript: Control Flow - Conditionals</h2>
                <h6>September 9, 2023</h6>
        
                <p>In the vast landscape of programming, control flow serves as the director of the script, orchestrating the sequence of actions based on specific conditions or loops. At the heart of this control lies the powerful tool of conditionals, guiding our code through decision-making pathways.</p>
        
                <h4>if/else Statements</h4>
        
                <p>The cornerstone of conditionals is the <code>if/else</code> statement. Behold its syntax:</p>
        
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>
                        if (/* condition is true */) {
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // run this code
                        <br>} else if (/* another condition is true */) {
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // run this code 
                        <br>} else if (/* yet another condition is true */) {
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // run this code 
                        <br>} else {
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // run this code as a catch-all 
                        <br>}
                    </code>
                </aside>
        
                <p>One of the beauties of <code>if/else</code> statements is their flexibility to handle various conditions. The code is read from top to bottom, and once a condition is true, the program executes the corresponding code and gracefully exits the set of statements.</p>
        
                <p>Let's put this to the test with a day-of-the-week scenario:</p>
        
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>
                        // declare a variable as a test case 
                        <br>let day = 'Friday'
        
                        <br><br>// create your statements
                        <br>if(day === 'Monday') {
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; console.log('Ugh. Back to work.')
                        <br>} else if(day === 'Wednesday') {
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; console.log('So close to the weekend!')
                        <br>} else if (day === 'Friday') {
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; console.log('It\'s the weekend, time for some self-care!!!')
                        <br>} else {
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; console.log('Just another day')
                        <br>}
                    </code>
                </aside>
        
                <p>Remember, when comparing variables to values, use <code>===</code> to check for equality.</p>
        
                <h4>Additional Operators</h4>
        
                <p>Beyond equality, conditionals involve an arsenal of operators to perform comparisons:</p>
        
                <ul>
                    <li><code><strong>&gt;</strong></code> : greater than</li>
                    <li><code><strong>&lt;</strong></code> : less than</li>
                    <li><code><strong>&gt;=</strong></code> : greater than or equal to</li>
                    <li><code><strong>&lt;=</strong></code> : less than or equal to</li>
                    <li><code><strong>!==</strong></code> : not equal to (<code>!</code> is known as the bang operator)</li>
                </ul>
        
                <p>These are the basics of <code>if/else</code> statements and operators, laying the foundation for more advanced conditionals like ternary operators and switch statements. As you progress, these concepts will become your allies in crafting sophisticated JavaScript scripts.</p>

                <h2>JavaScript: Arrays</h2>
                <h6>September 8, 2023</h6>
        
                <p>Arrays are the unsung heroes of programming. They're like versatile containers that help us store, organize, and manage data effortlessly. Let's dive into the world of JavaScript arrays and see how they work their magic.</p>
        
                <h4>Array Basics</h4>
        
                <p>In JavaScript, arrays are declared just like variables, but with a twist. They use square brackets to signify their array nature, like this:</p>
        
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>let array = ['itemOne', 'itemTwo', 'itemThree'];</code>
                </aside>
        
                <p>Each item in an array is stored sequentially and indexed, starting at 0 and ending at <code>length - 1</code>. Let's break down the array above:</p>
        
                <ul>
                    <li><code>'itemOne'</code> is at index 0</li>
                    <li><code>'itemTwo'</code> is at index 1</li>
                    <li><code>'itemThree'</code> is at index 2</li>
                    <li>While there are three elements in the array, the last index is always one less than the array's length.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h4>Getting the Length</h4>
        
                <p>You can easily find out how many elements are in an array using the <code>length</code> property:</p>
        
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>
                        let array = ['itemOne', 'itemTwo', 'itemThree'];
                        <br> array.length; // This will give you 3
                    </code>
                    </aside>
        
                <h4>Accessing Elements</h4>
        
                <p>To fetch a single element, use bracket notation. Specify the desired index inside square brackets. For instance, to access <code>'itemTwo'</code> from our array:</p>
        
                <aside id="code-block"> 
                    <code>array[1]; // This will give you 'itemTwo'</code>
                </aside>
        
                <h4>Array Superpowers</h4>
        
                <p>Arrays can do much more than storing data. They're your trusty sidekick for manipulating data. You can add, remove, or modify elements, among other things. Check out the resources below to explore these superpowers further.</p>
        
                <p>Arrays might seem simple, but they're a fundamental building block in programming. Mastering them will open doors to more complex data manipulation and make your code more efficient. Happy coding! 🔥👩‍💻👨‍💻</p>

                <h2>JavaScript: Variables and Data Types</h2>
                <h6>September 7, 2023</h6>
        
                <p>JavaScript empowers developers to bring interactivity to webpages through the execution of specific lines of code. However, working with the <code>script.js</code> file might not seem intuitive at first. When approaching coding, think of it as a written language rather than a spoken one. Most of the time, you must break down your actions into precise steps for the program to understand your intentions. For instance, while we casually say "one," in programming, we need to be explicit. We achieve this precision using variables.</p>
        
                <h4>What are Variables?</h4>
                <p>Variables are like containers that allow us to store and manage data in our programs. They are essential for making our code understandable and interactive.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Declaration:</strong> We start by declaring a variable using keywords like "let" or "const" (we'll dive into these later).</li>
                    <li><strong>Descriptive Name:</strong> Next, we give our variable a meaningful name, something that reflects the data it holds. For example, <code>let number</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equality:</strong> We use the equality symbol (<code>=</code>) to assign a value to our variable. For instance, <code>let number = 1</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Value:</strong> Finally, we specify the actual value the variable holds. In this case, we've told the program that there's a variable called "number," and it contains the value 1.</li>
                </ol>
        
                <p>A quick note: You might come across the keyword "var" in older code, but it's considered outdated. Stick with "let" and "const" for modern JavaScript.</p>
        
                <h4>Data Types</h4>
                <p>Now that we know how to declare variables let's explore different types of data they can hold. Think of data types as the building blocks of your program. Here are some fundamental ones:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Number Data Type:</strong> Use this to represent numeric values. Numbers can be integers (whole numbers) or floating-point numbers (numbers with decimals). For example:
                        <aside id="code-block">
                            <code>let age = 25; <br> let price = 9.99;</code>
                        </aside>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>String Data Type:</strong> Use this to represent text, and enclose it in double quotes, single quotes, or backticks:
                        <aside id="code-block">
                            <code>let greeting = "Hello!";</code>
                        </aside>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Boolean Data Type:</strong> This type represents true or false values. It's often used for conditions and logic:
                        <aside id="code-block">
                            <code>let isCodingFun = true; <br> let isRaining = false;</code>
                        </aside>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Null Data Type:</strong> Null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It's often used to signify that a variable should have no value:
                        <aside id="code-block">
                            <code>let emptyBox = null;</code>
                        </aside>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Undefined Data Type:</strong> Undefined is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet. It's the default value of a declared variable:
                        <aside id="code-block">
                            <code>let notDefinedYet; // This is undefined</code>
                        </aside>
                    </li>
                </ul>
        
                <p>With these data types, we can build complex programs and make our code more expressive.</p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>In JavaScript, you have two primary ways to declare variables: <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>. These keywords have different behaviors:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><code>let</code>:</strong> Variables declared with <code>let</code> can be reassigned. This means you can change their values after the initial assignment.</li>
                    <li><strong><code>const</code>:</strong> Variables declared with <code>const</code> are constant, meaning their values cannot be reassigned after the initial assignment. It's used for values that should remain unchanged throughout the program.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <p>Let's illustrate this with examples:</p>
        
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>let count = 10; 
                        <br> count = 20; // Valid, you can reassign 'count' with 'let' 
                        <br> console.log(count); // Outputs 20
                        <br><br> const pi = 3.14159;
                        <br> pi = 3.14; // Invalid, you can't reassign 'pi' with 'const'
                        <br> console.log(pi); // Outputs an error
                    </code>
                </aside>
        
                <p>In the first example, <code>count</code> is declared with <code>let</code>, so you can change its value later. In the second example, <code>pi</code> is declared with <code>const</code>, so attempting to change its value results in an error.</p>
                
                <p>Understanding when to use <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> is crucial for writing robust and maintainable code. Use <code>let</code> for variables that may change, and use <code>const</code> for values that should remain constant.</p>
        
                <h4>Practical Usage</h4>
                <p>Now that we have a bunch of variables, how do we visualize them? We use the <code>console.log()</code> function to display the value of a variable in the terminal. For instance, if we have a variable called <code>greeting</code>, we can see its value by typing <code>console.log(greeting)</code>.</p>
        
                <p>So, whether it's a number crunching or text processing, variables and data types are the foundation of JavaScript, allowing us to communicate precisely with our programs.</p>

                <h2>JavaScript: The Language of Web Interactivity</h2>
                <h6>September 6, 2023</h6>
        
                <p>
                    Every webpage we visit is like a playground of possibilities. A simple click of a button can transport us to
                    new worlds within the same page. And the enchanting tool that brings this interactivity to life? JavaScript(JS),
                    a versatile programming language that adds life and interactivity to the web.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    JavaScript is fundamental in web development. It's unique because it works both on the front-end and back-end of
                    web applications. Paired with HTML and CSS, it empowers you to create dynamic, interactive, and functional web
                    pages. Plus, it can communicate with databases, making it a powerhouse in modern web development.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    To practice JavaScript outside of your browser, you'll need NodeJS, a JavaScript runtime. If you're using a Mac
                    with Homebrew, open your terminal and enter <code>brew install node</code>. Alternatively, you can download
                    NodeJS from the link in the resources section.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Just like when we started with HTML and CSS, let's create a dedicated folder on your desktop. Name it "Intro to
                    JavaScript." Launch Visual Studio Code (VS Code), open this new folder via <code>File → Open Folder…</code>, and
                    you're ready to craft your first .js file.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    In the VS Code Explorer on the left, you'll see your folder. Click on it, choose <code>New File</code>, and name
                    it <code>script.js</code>. Congratulations, you've created your .js file. Now, let's make some magic happen.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    JavaScript can feel daunting, but think of it as a live performance. Your web page in the browser is the live
                    show, and rehearsals happen in the NodeJS environment, often with the trusty <code>console.log()</code> command.
                    For now, let's stick to rehearsals.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    In your <code>script.js</code>, add this line: <code>console.log('Hello World')</code>. You'll notice nothing
                    seems to happen. To see results, we need to run the file. In VS Code, go to <code>Terminal → New Terminal</code>
                    to open a terminal window within the application. It's the same terminal you're used to. To run your code, use
                    the command <code>node script.js</code>.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Go ahead and try a few more lines:
                </p>
        
                <ul>
                    <li><code>console.log(3 + 4)</code></li>
                    <li><code>console.log(true)</code></li>
                    <li><code>console.log('JavaScript is awesome!')</code></li>
                </ul>
        
                <p>
                    Run <code>node script.js</code> each time. Voilà!
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Remember, <code>console.log()</code> is your window into JavaScript's world outside the browser. The terminal
                    displays the output. Enjoy experimenting! Next, we'll dive into variables and data types.

                    <li>If you want to hide specific <code>console.log()</code> outputs, simply add <code>//</code> before the line
                    to comment it out. Commented code won't execute. For example, <code>//console.log(true)</code>.</li>

                <h2>Planning - A Lesson in Patience</h2>
                <h6>September 5, 2023</h6>
        
                <p>Software development is more than just coding. It's a collaborative effort that involves careful planning and coordination among different teams. In the world of technology, there are typically two approaches: one suggests meticulous planning to avoid potential problems like building the wrong features, excessive rework, complex solutions, and communication issues. The other approach believes in starting with an idea and allowing the project to evolve naturally. While both have their merits, most teams find that a well-thought-out plan ensures the success of their projects.</p>
        
                <h4>Product Management</h4>
                <p>Product ideas usually originate from the product management team. These ideas can involve creating a new product, adding features to an existing one, or refining existing aspects. Product managers act as advocates for customers within the organization, making sure that the market's voice is heard.</p>
                <p>One effective method for the product team to turn their ideas into actionable plans is by creating user stories. User stories are informal explanations of a software feature, framed from the end user or customer's perspective. They aim to clarify how a piece of work will deliver specific value to the customer.</p>
                <p>These stories use plain language without technical jargon to provide context for the development team. After reading a user story, the team understands why they are building something, what exactly they are building, and the value it will provide. User stories typically follow this format: "As a [persona], I [want to], [so that]."</p>
                <p>For example, consider this user story: "As a frequent online shopper, I want to be able to save items to my wishlist so that I can easily find and purchase them without searching for them again."</p>
        
                <h4>Design</h4>
                <p>Once the product team has a clear idea, they collaborate with designers to visualize it. Designers play a pivotal role in ideation, definition, and early prototyping of the product. They take the initial idea and translate it into tangible web pages based on the product team's concepts.</p>
                <p>Designers use tools like Figma to help create a visual representation of the final product's appearance and interactions.</p>
        
                <h4>Development Team</h4>
                <p>With a well-defined plan in hand, the development team takes over to build the product. This team includes developers responsible for the technical aspects, often alongside testing and quality assurance experts. They rely on the agreed-upon designs to guide their work, reducing guesswork.</p>
                <p>Developers use tools such as Trello or Jira to break down projects into manageable tasks, often referred to as stories or tickets. When multiple developers collaborate on a project, it's efficient for each developer to focus on one part at a time. Tickets can be further divided into smaller tasks based on the team's preferences.</p>
        
                <h4>Project Management</h4>
                <p>Now, let's not forget the crucial role played by project management 😁. Project managers are the conductors of this intricate orchestra. They coordinate the various elements of multiple projects, ensuring that each team member is in sync. Their goal is to avoid downtime and missteps in the development process.</p>
                <p>Project managers facilitate many of the important conversations throughout the project lifecycle. They act as liaisons between the product management, design, and development teams, ensuring that everyone is on the same page. They manage timelines, allocate resources, and identify potential bottlenecks before they become problems.</p>
                
                <br>
                <h4>Tool Agnosticism: A Student's Advantage</h4>
                <p>As a software development student, your journey may start with solo projects where you explore various tools, libraries, and frameworks. However, as you enter the industry, you'll collaborate with diverse teams, each with its own set of preferences and tools. This is where being tool-agnostic becomes your secret advantage.</p>
                <p>Being tool-agnostic means not overly relying on a single tool or technology stack. Instead, it's about having a flexible mindset that allows you to adapt to the tools used by your team or organization seamlessly. Here's why it matters:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Smooth Collaboration:</strong> In a professional setting, software development is a collaborative effort. Your ability to adapt to different tools and workflows enables you to seamlessly integrate into a team. It ensures that you're not limited by your toolset when working with colleagues who might have different preferences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> The tech industry evolves rapidly. What's popular today might not be tomorrow. By being tool-agnostic, you become versatile and ready to embrace new technologies and methodologies as they emerge. This adaptability is a valuable trait in the ever-changing world of software development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Different projects come with different requirements. Some tools are better suited for specific tasks than others. Being tool-agnostic empowers you to choose the right tool for the job, enhancing your problem-solving skills and efficiency.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>So, as a student, embrace the freedom to explore various tools and technologies. Build a strong foundation in the fundamentals of programming and development principles. But also, keep in mind that your journey doesn't end there. The ability to adapt and collaborate effectively with diverse teams will give you a significant advantage when you step into the industry. It's not just about what you know; it's about how well you can have meaningful conversations and contribute to the collective success of your team.</p>
                
                <br>
                <p>There isn't one prescribed way for these teams to work together. Each team finds an approach that suits them best, but it's essential to understand why planning at every phase is crucial. At the end of the day, it's a collaborative effort, and the more we can communicate and document our progress, the better off the team will be. The delicate balance between structured planning and agile project management is a conversation for another day.</p>

                <h2>Getting Started with Git and GitHub for Web Development</h2>
                <h6>September 4, 2023</h6>
        
                <p>You've just created a stunning webpage, and now it's time to share it with the world. Enter Git and GitHub – your allies in the journey of version control and collaborative web development.</p>
            
                <p>Git is a superhero among version control systems. It helps you keep track of changes to your files over time, a lifesaver when you're working with others or need to revert to a previous version of your code. GitHub, on the other hand, is the ultimate platform built around Git, offering online storage, collaboration tools, and version tracking.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Git and GitHub are not the same!</strong></p>
            
                <p>Before diving in, let's get familiar with some crucial terms:</p>
        
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Git Repository:</strong> Think of it as a time machine for your project, storing every change, who made it, and when. It's your ticket to accessing past versions of your code.</li>
                    <li><strong>Git Branches:</strong> These allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase without chaos. The "main" branch holds the stable code.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Repository:</strong> Your playground for coding, where you interact with Git on your machine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remotes:</strong> These are Git repositories typically hosted online (like on GitHub). They keep your local repository in sync with the remote one.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forking:</strong> Copying a repository to your own GitHub account. It's handy for making changes without affecting the original.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloning:</strong> Making a local copy of a remote repository. It's like having a duplicate of someone's project on your machine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pushing:</strong> Sending your local changes to the remote repository, akin to launching an aircraft on a journey.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pulling:</strong> Fetching and merging changes from the remote repository into your local one, ensuring your code is up-to-date.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Setting up Git and GitHub is quite involved, so you’ll need to following the documentation to get those set up!</p>
                    
                <p>When starting a new project, we want to turn a folder/directory into a Git repository, allowing you to track changes within it. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run <code>git init</code>.</p>
                
                <p>At the same time, let's create a new repository on GitHub.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Log in to your GitHub account.</li>
                    <li>Click on the "+" sign in the top-right corner of the page and select "New repository."</li>
                    <li>Choose a name for your repository, such as "personal-website."</li>
                    <li>Optionally, you can add a description for your repository.</li>
                    <li>Keep the repository as public.</li>
                    <li>Click on the "Create repository" button.</li>
                </ol>
        
                <p>Now that we’ve made changes to our project locally we want to update our GitHub repository to reflect those changes. We now have to go through a series of commands in our terminal. This process is analogous of going from one location to another via an airplane.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>After making changes locally, use <code>git add .</code> to stage them.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Git add</em> is like getting all the passengers scanned and boarded on the aircraft. The aircraft is still at the gate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <li>The next command is <code>git commit -m "&lt;insert a descriptive message&gt;"</code></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The aircraft has left the gate, and is on the runway. Waiting to take-off.</li>
                    </ul>
                                 
                    <li>To push your changes to GitHub, run <code>git push &lt;remote-name&gt; &lt;remote-branch-name&gt;</code>. <code>git push origin main</code> (for starters).</li>                  
                    <ul>
                        <li>Imagine your aircraft taking off, in transit, landing, taxiing, and deboarding at its destination.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <p>With your GitHub repository now mirroring your local one, remember to commit changes consistently and push them to your remote repository. Git and GitHub are powerful tools, and mastering them will elevate your web development game.</p>

                <h2>CSS: The Magic Wand of Web Styling</h2>
                <h6>September 3, 2023</h6>
        
                <p>Have you ever wondered how websites achieve their stunning visual designs? The secret sauce is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a powerful language that brings life and style to the structure provided by HTML. It's what allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of your web pages. In this journey through the world of CSS, we'll explore how it can transform a plain webpage into a visually captivating masterpiece.</p>
                               
                <p>There are a few ways to add CSS styles to your HTML documents, but today, we'll focus on the external stylesheet method.</p>
                
                <p>To get started, you need to create an external stylesheet. Here's how:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Navigate to Your HTML Folder:</strong> Find the folder where your HTML file is located.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create a New File:</strong> In that folder, create a new file and name it <code>styles.css</code>. This file will be your styling headquarters, where you'll work your magic.</li>
                </ol>
               
                <p>Now, here's where the magic happens: we need to link this stylesheet to our HTML document. We do this using the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag.</p>
                
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;</code>
                </aside>
        
                <p>The new element defines a relationship and the location of the relationship relative to the HTML file location. This new element should be placed between the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags and above the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag.</p>
        
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
                    <code id="indent-1">&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code>
                    <code id="indent-1">&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt;</code>
                    <code id="indent-1">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code>
                    <code id="indent-1">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;</code>
                    <code id="indent-1">&lt;title&gt;CSS: The Magic Wand of Web Styling&lt;/title&gt;</code>
                    <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>
                </aside>
        
                <p>Now that your HTML and CSS are connected, it's time to sprinkle some styling magic. We use CSS selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles. For example, you can change the background color of your <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> like this:</p>
        
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>header { </code>
                       <code id="indent-1"> background-color: gray;</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                </aside>
        
                <p>Let's enhance our webpage even further. How about changing the background color of the footer to black and the text to white? Here's how you can do it:</p>
        
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>header { </code>
                       <code id="indent-1"> background-color: gray;</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                    <code>footer { </code>
                       <code id="indent-1"> background-color: black;</code>
                       <code id="indent-1"> color: white;</code>
                    <code>}</code>
                </aside>
        
                <p>With CSS, you've got the magic wand to create web designs that dazzle and inspire. So go ahead, unleash your creativity and make your web pages truly shine!</p>

                <h2>HTML: The Art of Structuring Your Webpage</h2>
                <h6>September 2, 2023</h6>
        
                <p>Have you ever looked at a webpage and wondered how it's all organized? The secret lies in the structure, and in the web development realm, that structure is built with HTML. Today, we'll embark on a journey to create a basic webpage structure and then refine it using semantic HTML tags.</p>
            
                <p>In the vast landscape of web development, starting with a solid structure is crucial. The way you organize your content not only affects how your webpage looks but also how it performs in search engines and how accessible it is to everyone. Let's dive in!</p>
            
                <p>We'll begin with a simple webpage that is structured using &lt;div&gt; elements. These elements are like building blocks that help us organize content. Here's what our initial HTML structure will look like:</p>
        
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
                    <code>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</code>
                        <code id="indent-1">&lt;head&gt;</code>
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code>
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt;</code>
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code>
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;title&gt;The Art of Structuring&lt;/title&gt;</code>
                        <code id="indent-1">&lt;/head&gt;</code>
            
                        <code id="indent-1">&lt;body&gt;</code>
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;div&gt;</code>
                                <code id="indent-3">&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Webpage&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;/div&gt;</code>
                            
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;div&gt;</code>
                                <code id="indent-3">&lt;ul&gt;</code>
                                    <code id="indent-4">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code>
                                    <code id="indent-4">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code>
                                    <code id="indent-4">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code>
                                <code id="indent-3">&lt;/ul&gt;</code>
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;/div&gt;</code>
                            
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;div&gt;</code>
                                <code id="indent-3">&lt;h2&gt;About Me&lt;/h2&gt;</code>
                                <code id="indent-3">&lt;p&gt;This is where you'll learn all about me.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;/div&gt;</code>
                            
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;div&gt;</code>
                                <code id="indent-3">&lt;p&gt;&copy; 2023 My Webpage&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;/div&gt;</code>
                        <code id="indent-1">&lt;/body&gt;</code>
                    <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code></code>
                </aside>
        
                <p>To make our structure even more understandable, we can add unique identifiers using the <strong>id</strong> attribute to each &lt;div&gt; element. This helps with code readability and makes it easier to target specific parts of our webpage programmatically.</p>
        
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>

                        <code id="indent-1">&lt;head&gt;</code>
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code>

                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;title&gt;The Art of Structuring&lt;/title&gt;</code>
                        <code id="indent-1">&lt;/head&gt;</code>

                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;/div&gt;</code>
                            
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;div id="main"&gt;</code>
                                <code id="indent-3">&lt;h2&gt;About Me&lt;/h2&gt;</code>

                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;/div&gt;</code>
                            
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;div id="footer"&gt;</code>
                                <code id="indent-3">&lt;p&gt;&copy; 2023 My Webpage&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;/div&gt;</code>
                        <code id="indent-1">&lt;/body&gt;</code>
                    <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code></code>
                </aside>
                
                <p>In a well-structured webpage, the header typically features a warm welcome or branding at the very top. The navigation section, indicated by the &lt;nav&gt; element, defines links that help users navigate your site. The main content area, enclosed within the &lt;main&gt; element, holds the bulk of your webpage's content. Lastly, the footer, positioned at the bottom, often contains supplementary information and links.</p>

                <p>While &lt;div&gt; elements provide structure, HTML5 introduced a set of semantic tags that add meaning to your webpage's structure. Let's refactor our initial HTML using these semantic tags for a more accessible and SEO-friendly result.</p>
        
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>

                        <code id="indent-1">&lt;head&gt;</code>
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code>
                            <code id="indent-2">&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt;</code>

                <p>By using semantic tags like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;, we've not only improved the clarity of our code but also made it more accessible to users and search engines. Semantic HTML tells browsers and screen readers what each section of your webpage represents.</p>

                <h2>HTML Basics: Getting Started with Web Development</h2>
                <h6>September 1, 2023</h6>
                <p>Ever wondered how words and images seamlessly materialize on our browsers? If you're curious about the inner workings of the web, you're in for a treat! Let's embark on a journey to explore the foundational language that brings web content to life: <strong>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</strong>.</p>
            
                <p>When you navigate the web or interact with websites, you're interacting with HTML. It's like the blueprint of a webpage, defining the structure and layout of the user experience on the other side of the screen.</p>
            
                <p>To kickstart your HTML coding journey, you'll need a trusty code editor. My personal favorite? <strong>Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</strong>. While you wait for the download, why not create a folder named 'Intro to HTML' on your 'Desktop'? This is where you'll practice your newfound skills using the <strong>Terminal</strong>. We'll come back to that folder shortly. Once VS Code is downloaded, open it up and explore the interface. Remember, always open the folder you're working with by navigating to <code>File → Open Folder…</code>. Locate your 'Intro to HTML' folder and dive in. You're now primed to craft your very first .html file!</p>
            
                <p>The VS Code Explorer on the left side will showcase the folder you've just opened. Click on the folder, revealing several options. Opt for <code>New File</code>, and name it <code>index.html</code>. Voilà! You've just authored an .html document. Now, let's conjure up some magic.</p>
            
                <p>Type in <code>Hello World</code> into the index.html file. Now, journey to your desktop, crack open the 'Intro to HTML' folder, and double-click the index.html file. Watch as a new browser window (I prefer Chrome) springs to life, displaying the illustrious words <code>Hello World</code>. Congratulations, magician!</p>
            
                <p>But wait, it's not all enchantment and ease...</p>
            
                <p>The index.html file must be structured in a way that browsers can decode its contents. It craves the following elements:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> → A nod to the browser about the document type ahead.</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code> → The grand container of all HTML elements.</li>
                </ol>

                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
                    <code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>
                </aside>
            
                <p>Imagine <code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code> as a treasure chest cradling all the secrets necessary to whisk the contents of index.html into a visually captivating web page. But, we're not done yet.</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> → A chamber for metadata.</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> → The sanctuary for all our content.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
                    <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
                    <code id="indent-1">&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code>
                    <code id="indent-1">&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>
                    <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>
                </aside>

                <p>Within the head tags resides metadata that defines the document you're conjuring. This metadata won't be visible on the webpage.</p>
            
                <p>The body tags, on the other hand, house the content destined for display in the browser.</p>
            
                <p>As we sculpt the document's architecture, we add layers of detail, allowing the browser to interpret and enchant. I'll adorn the head with some metadata, but I encourage you to dive deeper into each element's significance.</p>
                
                <aside id="code-block">
                    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
                    <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
                    <code id="indent-1">&lt;head&gt;</code>
                        <code id="indent-2">&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code>
                        <code id="indent-2">&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt;</code>
                        <code id="indent-2">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code>
                        <code id="indent-2">&lt;title&gt;Intro to HTML&lt;/title&gt;</code>
                    <code id="indent-1">&lt;/head&gt;</code>
                    <code id="indent-1">&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>
                    <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>                      
                </aside>

               

                <p>Now we are ready to add content!</p>
            
                <p>Let's summon the following between the body tags: <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;</code>.</p>
            
                <p>HTML wields an arsenal of tags to conjure diverse elements. These tags nestle within angle brackets (<code>&lt;&gt;</code>). Behold a few often-used spells:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>: Headings of varying importance, with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> as the mightiest and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> as the meekest.</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code>: A paragraph of text.</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;img&gt;</code>: Summons an image to grace your web page.</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code>: Weaves a hyperlink to another realm.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>After birthing your index.html file, within the file type <code>!</code> and hit <code>return</code>. This invokes the HTML boilerplate from the Emmet toolkit, sparing you the chore of typing out the boilerplate!</li>
                    <li>Utilize indentation – it's the cornerstone of impeccable structure, organization, and code readability.</li>

                <h2>MacOS Terminal</h2>
                <h6>August 31, 2023</h6>
                <p>Picture a green font against a black backdrop – a scene often portrayed in movies involving hackers. These visuals are always captivating, yet they might seem distant for the average person. Join me as we take a step closer to realizing your 'hacker-esque' dreams.</p>
                
                <p>The terminal is a tool developers use to execute instructions on a computer. It provides text-based access to the operating system. Renowned for its speed, the terminal offers a plethora of utilities, from navigating files and folders to running scripts that automate tasks. Let's embark on our first journey into the world of the MacOS terminal.</p>
                
                <p>To open the terminal, simply use Spotlight Search (press <code>command</code> + <code>spacebar</code>), type 'terminal,' and hit return. Voila! A new terminal window should materialize on your screen. For many of us, the terminal might lack the style of the green/black design mentioned earlier; instead, it could be a white screen with black font. You can always go to <code>Terminal → Settings</code>, click on the <code>Profile</code> tab, and personalize the background and font color to your liking.</p>
                
                <p>Now that your terminal has a touch of swag, let's attempt to grasp how it functions. When I contemplate writing code or how the computer interprets a user's actions, I visualize every click I've made from the moment the computer is turned on to my current state. For instance, turning my computer on and logging into my account means I've accessed my MacOS and then my user account. So, if you were to type <code>pwd</code> into your terminal and press return, an address will be displayed – usually something like <code>/Users/&lt;your-username&gt;</code>. The command <code>pwd</code> shows your current location in the terminal; it stands for "print working directory." Let's break down our location or path: <code>/Users/&lt;your-username&gt;</code>. </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The <code>/</code> symbolizes the root directory. All paths start from the root directory, analogous to booting your computer. </li>
                    <li><code>/Users</code> signifies that you've entered the Users directory – the screen displaying all users on the computer. </li>
                    <li><code>/Users/&lt;your-username&gt;</code> implies that you've logged into a specific account. This becomes your starting directory or path every time you launch your terminal.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Before we proceed, let's pause for a quick sidebar. There are a few terms we should acquaint ourselves with:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Directory</strong>: Often used interchangeably with 'folder.' While not precisely the same, for now, let's assume they are: directory = folder.</li>
                    <li><strong>Path</strong>: The location of a file or folder in a file system (e.g., <code>/Users/&lt;your-username&gt;</code>). I begin in the root directory (<code>/</code>), move into the Users directory (<code>/Users</code>), and then arrive at a user directory (<code>/User/&lt;your-username&gt;</code>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Absolute Path</strong>: The exact location of a file or folder from the root directory (e.g., <code>/User/&lt;your-username&gt;</code>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Relative Path</strong>: A reference to a file or folder relative to your current position.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Feeling a bit perplexed? Don't worry; it'll make sense soon. Let's return to the main session.</p>
  
                <p>Now that we've logged into our account and used the <code>pwd</code> command to confirm our location, let's forge ahead. I can now type <code>ls</code> into my terminal to view the contents of the current directory. If I want to enter or access the Desktop directory, I can either:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Use the absolute path: <code>cd /Users/&lt;your-username&gt;/Desktop</code></li>
                    <li>Use the relative path: <code>cd Desktop</code></li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>The text to the left of the cursor indicates your current directory. You can always use <code>pwd</code> to see the absolute path.</p>
                
                <p>Let's take a quick peek into how the temrinal compares to our computer's Graphical User Interface (GUI): </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Type <code>pwd</code> into the terminal, to view your location</li>
                    <li>Type <code>ls</code> into the terminal, to list the contents in the current directory</li>
                    <li>Type <code>cd Desktop</code> to enter the 'Desktop' directory </li>
                    <li>Create three folders in the 'Desktop' directory --- Type <code>mkdir <em>folderName</em></code> --- Keep an eye on the GUI!</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>mkdir FolderOne</code></li>
                            <li><code>mkdir "Folder Two"</code></li>
                            <li><code>mkdir "Folder\ Three"</code></li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Type <code>ls</code> into the terminal, to list the contents in the current directory</li>
                    <li>Type <code>cd FolderOne</code> to enter the 'FolderOne' directory </li>
                    <li>Type <code>touch document.txt</code>, to create a new file with the .txt extension --- Double click the respective folder in your GUI to see the results </li>
                    <li>Repeat the above step to create a  file with a .pdf extension </li>
                    <li>Type <code>cd ..</code> into the terminal to exit the current directory and return to the 'Desktop' directory</li>
                    <li>You try! --- add a file to another folder.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Congratulations, you're now a few steps closer to becoming a programming wizard. Keep exploring your terminal and experiment with the commands in the next section.</p>
